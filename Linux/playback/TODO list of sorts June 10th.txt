TODO list of sorts
- Create a new MotionModule, call it Playback                               Done
   
      class Playback: public MotionModule {
       ....
      }

- It should take as a constructor the filename of the textfile you want to replay
- It should have an internal counter which remembers what offset we are into the textfile (offset = tick * num joints)
- It should also have a buffer of doubles which is num_ticks*num_joints in size
- Playback::Initialize() should do two things:                              Done
    1) reset the offset to 0
    2) set all joints to be enabled (like playback.cpp does)
- Playback::Process() should do two things:                                 Done
    1) set the m_Joint to reflect joint angles from the current tick
    2) if current tick is not last one, increment the current tick
   
- Need to eventually set up a new repo for darwin code                      Done
- Would be nice to convert ROBOTIS 1.6.0 darwin code to use CMake           Done
- Investigate making dt be 8ms in TrajectoryManager on desktop 				DONE
